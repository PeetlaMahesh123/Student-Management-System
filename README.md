# 🎓 Student Management System (Java Desktop Application)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Management System** is a Java-based desktop application developed using **Swing and JFrame** for the user interface and **JDBC** for database connectivity.
It allows administrators to efficiently manage student records such as adding, updating, viewing, and deleting student information using an SQL database.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **core Java, GUI development, and database integration**, making it suitable for academic and fresher-level portfolios.
